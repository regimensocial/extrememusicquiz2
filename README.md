# extrememusicquiz2
This was my GCSE Computer Science Programming Project.

It is perhaps the most dramatic interpretation of [Task 1](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/503195-programming-project-tasks-june-2019-and-june-2020.pdf). 
This was my first time using C# to make a UI. I think this is using WPF, but the naming systems are quite confusing.

The code behind this is probably not amazing, we started this in like February 2020 and then a deadly pandemic shut down the world.
I spent the first few months of school pretending I was doing my project, then one week I got really worried that it was randomly going to be checked, so I made this in a weekend towards the end of 2020.

The original was "extrememusicquiz" which I started before the pandemic, and then I wanted to restart it when it was time to actually make this, hence why this is number two.

This project was never assessed or even looked at as far as I know (exam season Summer 2021), but I was asked to record a demo of it in case it was needed for evidence. I might link that soon, as well as packaging a release.

I also made the most difficult music quiz ever by having people submit different songs on my Snapchat Story, so somewhere there is a save file with like 100 songs all of varying genres and tastes.
This has all the features plus more, it has a useless playlist function which can't actually be used in the quiz.

I did actually really like WPF, but I now prefer to use Qt due to cross-compatibility; this is Windows only sadly.
